Dynamic Data Visualization Tool (Python)

This project is a Python GUI application that helps beginners analyze CSV data visually. It automatically detects numeric columns from a dataset, calculates their averages, and allows users to generate bar charts, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps using a simple Tkinter interface.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate basic data analysis and visualization concepts using Python libraries in an interactive way.

Features

Automatically detects numeric columns from a CSV file

Calculates average values for all numeric columns

Displays averages directly in the GUI

Generates:

Bar chart for averages

Scatter plot for any two selected columns

Correlation heatmap

Easy-to-use graphical interface (no command line needed)

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas (data handling)

Matplotlib (data visualization)

Tkinter (GUI)
